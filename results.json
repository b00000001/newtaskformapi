This is where the required purchase is a truckload.  It might be 20 different items, but whatever they buy needs to equal one semi full.\r\n\r\n2) Items that when anything from a specific vendor is ordered, they want to see if they need anything else from that vendor (Think Home Depot).\r\n\r\n3) Commodity Buys.  This is where they are going to place a bulk order because of expected change in cost.  PVC fittings are a good example here.  When they hear of a price increase they will do a bulk purchase based on future savings rather than stock needs\r\n\r\nAs such, the idea is to create an alternate workflow for these vendors.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, we need to create a Manage Vendors Screen in Cycle Count.  It's important that this be a screen, not a config file.\r\n\r\nIn this screen, you will have the following columns and features:\r\n\r\nAdd Vendor (+)\r\n\r\nGrid with sort\r\n\r\nVendor ID.     Vendor Name     Vendor [  ]  Bulk : UoM [  ]  $ Buy [  ]\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Vendor\" checkbox is selected, the workflow changes so that when any item falls below the minimum for an item from that vendor, instead of it showing up as a recommended purchase in requisitions, it generates a new count for everything from that vendor, regardless of location.\r\n\r\nKeeping with the example of Home Depot items, there are only about 10 items, but some are in 0101, 0102 & 0104.  They don't want to place a home depot order for 1 item, since it is a manual process.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bulk \"UoM\"  or \"$ Buy\" checkbox is selected, the workflow changes so that then any items falls below the minimum for an item from that vendor, instead of it showing up as a recommended purchase in requisitions, it generates a new count for everything from that vendor, regardless of location.  But in this situation, the requisition screen itself is different.  Once the count is complete then the requisition screens is designed to help them make informed bulk purchase decisions.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is Caliber Steel.  When they order caliber steel products, they have to purchase a semi truck load.  In that case a semi truck=20 pallets.  We need to either add a UoM of \"truck\" or build logic such that the reorder QTY across all caliber steel products is 20 pallets.  Not one item, it is any mix that gets us to 20 pallets.  The app is designed to help them decide which are the best 20 pallets.  But it may not be pallets, it could just be minimum units, so we might have a UoM or selection called \"BULK\" with a conversion of 10000 EA.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this, I propose replacing the reorder qty to be dynamic based on usage over the previous 6 months.  Usage is defined as a reduction in inventory.  This reduction will typically be a decrease both adjustment that was done by the cycle count app, but we need to think through additional scenarios.\r\n\r\nSo, when a caliber item falls below the minimum, a count is done on all caliber items and then our app suggests 2 pallets of this and 3 pallets of that and 6 pallets of the other based on usage.  I am thinking this should be based on all products available, based on % of usage, rounded to the pallet UoM.  So if an item represents 1/20th of the usage, then we would order 1 pallet.  If it represents 50% of the usage, we would order 10 pallets.  I am open to other approaches on this algorithm.\r\n\r\nNext up is exactly the same approach, but instead of it being a truck or\" BULK - 10000\". it may just be a minimum spend.  So it this situation, we need to suggest a product mix based on what the threshold is.  So if they need to spend $25,000, the app recommends the best product mix based on usage (same algorithm).  Note that this functionality will also be used for \"Free Product\".  Frequently vendors will give Price Brothers a \"rebate\", which allows them to use the rebate to 'purchase' product.  This results in a zero dollar purchase order in sage.  So on this version of the app, we need to add a $0 checkbox, that when checked, changes the cost to zero on the corresponding order.\r\n\r\nI assume we need to setup a time to talk about this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
